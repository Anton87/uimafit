Here is the current (but not perfect) procedure for creating a release:

First update the javadoc pages:
  * temporarily edit the pom file to specify the release version (rather than the snapshot version)
  * run the following
{{{ 
>cd uimafit-home-dir
>mvn javadoc:javadoc
>cp -R target\site\apidocs .
}}}
  * be sure to change the pom file back so that the version is the snapshot version
  * commit files to the repository before performing the release so that they get tagged correctly.

Next run the following:

{{{
>cd uimafit-home-dir
>mvn release:prepare
>mvn release:perform
}}}
This does everything except upload a new downloadable to the project downloads page.  This task (as well as the javadoc generation) can probably be accomplished using the antrun plugin (see [http://maven.riedelcastro.org/gcupload-maven-plugin/usage.html this].)  Uploading the new downloadable files can be done by clicking on the Downloads tab above and following the instructions.  The files should be located in the target directory.  

One final thing to do is edit the front page to have the correct xml for a project's pom file - i.e. edit the snippet 
{{{
<version>0.9.13</version>
}}}
so that it is up-to-date.
