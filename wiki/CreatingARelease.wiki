Here is the current (but not perfect) procedure for creating a release:

First update the javadoc pages:
  * temporarily edit the pom file to specify the release version (rather than the snapshot version)
  * run the following
{{{ 
>cd uutuc-home-dir
>mvn javadoc:javadoc
>cp -R target\site\apidocs .
}}}
  * be sure to change the pom file back so that the version is the snapshot version

Next run the following:

{{{
>cd uutuc-home-dir
>mvn release:prepare
>mvn release:perform
}}}
This does everything except upload a new downloadable to the project downloads page.  This task (as well as the javadoc generation) can probably be accomplished using the antrun plugin (see [http://maven.riedelcastro.org/gcupload-maven-plugin/usage.html this].)  Uploading the new downloadable files can be done by clicking on the Downloads tab above and following the instructions.  The files should be located in the target directory.
